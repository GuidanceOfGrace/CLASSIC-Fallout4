# This file contains plugin names that CLASSIC will IGNORE while scanning your crash logs and mod files.
# When adding plugin names, make sure you add it under the correct game list, same applies to VR plugins.

# To add plugin names yourself, make sure each plugin starts with a dash followed by a space,
# AND ends with either .esm | .esp | .esl | .dll | Uppercase / lowercase does not matter.
