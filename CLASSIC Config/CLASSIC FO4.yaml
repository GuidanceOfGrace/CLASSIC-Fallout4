Default_FIDMods: |  # Default text for *FO4 FID Mods.yaml* if that file doesn't already exist.
  >>> THIS IS ONLY A PLACEHOLDER | YOU NEED TO GENERATE THIS FILE WITH FO4EDIT!
  
  - CLASSIC can automatically look up (most) values of mod FormIDs, you just need to generate your own FormID List.
  
  - To generate the FormID List:
    1) Place the *Generate FormID List.pas* from the CLASSIC Config folder into your FO4Edit/Edit Scripts folder.
    2) Now run FO4Edit.exe and check all plugins you wish to include in the FormID List (I RECOMMEND YOU CHECK ALL PLUGINS).
    3) Press OK while holding [Shift] to load your plugins in FO4Edit. Once all plugins are loaded, right click on any plugin and select *Apply Script...*
    4) From the dropdown menu, select *Generate FormID List* and press OK. Depending on how many plugins you have, this will take some time (5-25 mins).
    5) Once the full FormID List is generated, FO4Edit will ask you to save this list. Save it as a text file, then rename it to: FO4 FID Mods.txt
    6) Now place your own generated *FO4 FID Mods.txt* file into the CLASSIC Config folder and overwrite the existing *FO4 FID Mods* file.
       (Make sure the original *FO4 FID Mods.txt* gets overwritten! If it doesn't, check the name or change the file extension to .txt)
    7) Run CLASSIC, enable *Show FID Values* under CLASSIC Settings and that's it! Scan your crash logs, the autoscan will do the rest.
  
    [!] REMINDERS
    
      - Once you overwrite the original *FO4 FID Mods.txt* (this file), crash log file scan will take (much) longer.
      To ensure the scan doesn't take as long, only scan a few crash logs (less than 10) at any given time.
      [ Delete or move any extra crash log files to another folder so CLASSIC can't find them. ]
      
      - The script will not be able to generate values for ALL FormIDs, around 12% don't have usable names that CLASSIC can display.
      You will see [CHECK MANUALLY WITH XEDIT] for these FormIDs. These are usually NavMesh records, but check with FO4Edit anyway.
      
      - To stop CLASSIC from checking the FormID List, either delete, rename or move your generated *FO4 FID Mods.txt* file somewhere else.
      CLASSIC will simply create this placeholder file again if needed and stop checking FormID values until a new FormID List is provided.
