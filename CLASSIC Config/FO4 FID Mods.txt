>>> THIS IS ONLY A PLACEHOLDER | YOU NEED TO GENERATE THIS FILE WITH FO4EDIT!

- CLASSIC can automatically look up (most) values of mod FormIDs, you just need to generate your own FormID List.

- To generate the FormID List:
  1) Place the *Generate FormID List.pas* from the CLASSIC Config folder into your FO4Edit/Edit Scripts folder.
  2) Now run FO4Edit.exe and check all plugins you wish to include in the FormID List (I RECOMMEND YOU CHECK ALL PLUGINS).
  3) Press OK while holding [Shift] to load your plugins in FO4Edit. Once all plugins are loaded, right click on any plugin and select *Apply Script...*
  4) From the dropdown menu, select *Generate FormID List* and press OK. Depending on how many plugins you have, this will take some time (5-25 mins).
  5) Once the full FormID List is generated, FO4Edit will ask you to save this list. Save it as a text file with the name: FO4 FID Mods.txt
  6) Now place your own generated *FO4 FID Mods.txt* file into the CLASSIC Config folder and overwrite the existing *FO4 FID Mods* file.
     (Make sure the original *FO4 FID Mods.txt* gets overwritten! If it doesn't, check the name or change the file extension to .txt)
  7) That's it! Run CLASSIC and scan your crash logs. The autoscan will do the rest.
  
[!] REMINDERS

  - Once you overwrite the original *FO4 FID Mods.txt* (this file), crash log file scan will take (much) longer.
  To make sure the scan isn't as slow, only scan a few crash logs (less than 10) at any time.
  [ Delete or move any extra crash log files to another folder so CLASSIC can't find them. ]
  
  - The script will not be able to generate values for ALL FormIDs, around 10% don't have usable names that CLASSIC can display.
  You will see [CHECK MANUALLY WITH XEDIT] for these FormIDs. These are usually NavMesh records, but check with FO4Edit anyway.
  
  - To stop CLASSIC from checking the FormID List, either delete, rename or move your generated *FO4 FID Mods.txt* file somewhere else.
  CLASSIC will simply create this placeholder file again if needed and stop checking FormID values until a new FormID List is provided.
