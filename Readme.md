# CONTENTS & FILES #

Crash Log Auto-Scanner is bundled with several files:

*Scan Readme.md* - The file that you're reading right now.

*Crash Log Auto Scanner.exe* - Main exe for scanning crash logs generated by Buffout 4. You can place any crash logs into the same folder with this exe
and press SCAN LOGS button to scan them. After scanning completes, close the exe window, then open any *-AUTOSCAN.md* file and read what it says.

*CLAS Settings.ini* - Configuration file for original source scripts and the exe where some CLAS settings can be adjusted.

*HOW TO READ CRASH LOGS.pdf* - Document that lists most common Buffout 4 crash log messages and errors, and ways to prevent or fix them.

*CL TOOLS* - Folder with extra scripts for sorting & compraing crash logs. [For advanced users and some troubleshooting purposes.]

# BINARY SEARCH 101 #

It's an algorithm (method) for tracking down the exact crash culprit as fast as possible when crash logs aren't helpful. Here's a clear example on how to do it.
Of course, this method can (very) rarely backfire since the game could crash due to missing scripts from deactivated content, but it is what it is.
Let's say you have 200 activated plugins in total, and let's give all those plugins arbitrary names. (Plugin1, Plugin2, Plugin3... all the way to Plugin200).

First, backup your latest save before doing this! Saves are located in your Documents\My Games\Fallout4\Saves folder.
Your goal is to disable half, only leave all plugins from Plugin1 to Plugin100 enabled. After that:

-> If the game crashes again, then you know the culprit is somewhere between Plugin1 and Plugin100.  Now you disable half of those, so you only leave plugins from
Plugin1 to Plugin50 enabled and test again. Each time you crash, disable half of the plugin range from which you deduced it must contain the crashing mod.

-> If the game doesn't crash,  then you know the culprit is somewhere between Plugin101 and Plugin200. Now enable half of the ones you disabled, so you leave plugins from
Plugin101 to Plugin150 enabled and test again. Each time you don't crash, enable half of the plugin range from which you deduced it must contain the crashing mod.

Repeat this logic until you're (hopefully) left with one mod that you had to leave disabled for the game not to crash, and that's your culprit.
Basically, for each group of mods you disable, whichever half crashes is the one that contains the Impostor. Use your sussy brain to vote him out. à¶ž
After that, enable all other mods and continue from the save before you stared the binary search (in case you kept making exit saves while testing it out). 
Another example, with mods A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H:

ABCDEFGH
Crash

ABCD | EFGH
Crash

AB | CD EFGH
Crash

A | B CDEFGH
No Crash

B must be the culprit since the game didn't crash with only Mod A enabled while all other mods are disabled, but it did crash with both Mod A & B enabled.

# LATEST CHANGES #

6.66 | "No Step On Snek" Update
* MAIN SCRIPT *
- Various parity updates between *Crash Log Auto Scanner* and *Plugin Auto Cleaning Tool*

- Buffout 4 NG/VR will now be the recommended Buffout version by default until further notice.
- Fixed missing Scripts folder crash that occured if F4SE wasn't already manually installed.
- Keybind errors from *xSE PluginPreloader.log* are now excluded to prevent false positives.
- Creation Kit logs are now excluded from error detection to prevent false positives.
- Removed F4SE check for crash logs as this became redundant with game files check.
- Improved detection for some crash culprits and adjusted report formatting style.
- Added detection for *.dll* files for the *List Of Detected (Named) Records*.
- [Log and culprit stats are currently disabled until a better method is found.]

* OTHER FILES *
- Renamed INI file for adjusting *Crash Log Auto Scanner* settings to *CLAS Settings.ini*
- Removed python requirements and other related python warnings from the CLAS executable.
- Raw scripts are no longer included with CLAS files on Nexus, they are now exlusive to GitHub.
- [You can still find the raw scripts on CLAS Github page, they're not required to run the EXE.]
