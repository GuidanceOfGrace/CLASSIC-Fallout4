GameVR_Hints:
  - 'Random Hint: [Ctrl] + [F] is a handy-dandy key combination. You should use it more often. Please.'
  - 'Random Hint: Patrolling the Buffout 4 Nexus Page almost makes you wish this joke was more overused.'
  - 'Random Hint: Buffout crash logs are generated in your Documents/My Games/Fallout4VR/F4SE folder by default.'
  - "Random Hint: You have a crash log where the autoscan couldn't find any solutions? Feel free to send it to me."
  - 'Random Hint: 20% of all crashes are caused by Classic Holstered Weapons mod. 80% of all statistics are made up.'
  - "Random Hint: No, I don't know why your game froze instead of crashed. But I know someone who might know; Google."
  - "Random Hint: If you don't use Profile Specific INIs, consider disabling this option in your MO2 Profile settings."
  - 'Random Hint: Spending 5 morbillion hours asking for help can save you from 5 minutes of reading the documentation.'
  - "Random Hint: When necessary, make sure that crashes are consistent or repeatable, since in rare cases they aren't."
  - 'Random Hint: Revisit both Buffout 4 Crash Article and CLASSIC Nexus Page from time to time in case there are updates.'
  - "Random Hint: When posting crash logs, it's helpful to mention the last thing you were doing before the crash happened."
