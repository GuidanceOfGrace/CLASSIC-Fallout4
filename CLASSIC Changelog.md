# CLASSIC CHANGELOG #

7.00 | PLACEHOLDER
- *Game Corruption Crash* renamed to *Animation Data Crash*, crash info has been updated.
- Several code optimizations thanks to [evildarkarchon] on GitHub, plus some bugs squashed.
- Added few redundant / irrelevant errors to the internal exclusion list so they are ignored.
- Another attempt to fix a weird crash / error caused by *Dumpstack.log* for some reason.
- Fixed an issue where CLAS wasn't correctly checking logs in the game root folder.
- Fixed an issue where CLAS wasn't correctly detecting the GPU in some rare cases.
- [If you still get an error for Dumpstack.log, let me know and run CLAS in admin mode.]
